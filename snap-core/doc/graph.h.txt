/// [Undirected graph]
Node IDs can be arbitrary non-negive integers. Nodes and edges have no attributes/data associated with them.
There is at most one undirected edge between a pair of nodes. This means self loops (one per node) are allowed but multiple (parallel) edges are not.
The undirected graph data structire is implemented using sorted adjacency lists.
This means adding a node takes constant time, while adding an edge takes linear time (since adjacency list is kept sorted).
Accessing arbitrary node takes constant time and accessing any edge takes logarithmic time.
